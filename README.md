## JavaScript Assignment 2 - Timers

I am currently a student in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. After covering the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript we are now completing our week 6 assignment. For this assignment we are tasked with making a trivia game using JavaScript, featuring a timer.

I hope you enjoy checking it out.

### Here's how the game should work:

1. Choose a theme for your game! 

2. Create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

3. The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

    * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
    * Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

4. Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
